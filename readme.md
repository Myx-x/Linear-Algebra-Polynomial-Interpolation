# What is this project about?

<p>This project was made in order to fill the requirements of the Linear and Geometric Algebra class in ITB Informatics Engineering. This project consists of several features, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gauss Elimination Algorithm</li>
    <li>Gauss-Jordan Elimination Algorithm</li>
    <li>Graph Interpolation from given points</li>
    <li>Study case examples</li>
    <li><i>..and so much more!</i></li>
</ul>

# Prerequisites
<p>This program was made under several conditions:
<ul>
    <li>Using Java SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0_221. (JDK)</li>
</ul>

# What's this <i>Florencia</i> doing about in this program?
<p>We called our library system by the name of <b>Florencia</b>, as the package name. It is based on our classmate, Florencia Wijaya (13518020) as a tribute to her. Also note that we already made an agreement about making her name our project codename :).</p>

# How do you run this program?
## Using batch file
<ol>
    <li>Run `compile.bat` once, it will run the program after you made any changes in the program</li>
    <li>If you only didn't make any change/made changes only in Menu.java/Main.java, we suggest you to only run the `run.bat`</li>
</ol>

## Manually compile using `javac` and running using `java`
<ol>
    <li>Type in into command line :`javac ./florencia/augmentedmatrix/*.java`</li>
    <li>Also type in into command line :`javac ./florencia/matrix/*.java`</li>
    <li>Type in into command line to compile then run the program :`javac Menu.java` and `java Menu`</li>
</ol>

# How do you use this program?

<p><i>TBA</i></p>
